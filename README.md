This submission is a week 2 project for UCF Coding bootcamp

The object of this lesson was to improve and utilize advanced css, flexboxes, and media query . As this project was a 'even week' the code was to be developed from scrath.

Compounding on last weeks project, I ensured that i was in the proper git branch/working repositiory to comply with one of the grading rubrix values in addition to attempting it to be a good habit builder.

Experimentation:
  1. Trying to expand a bit past the miniumums I used some css 'tricks' i found online i.e. clip path and gradients. They worked out quite well, with the exception the 'clip path generator' did not align with the css like it should have. This led to some troubleshooting and exploration to deepen my understanding of how clip path works to be able to modify it to do exactly what I wanted. I found it quite interesting.
  
Issues I encountered:
  1. I had a issue referencing live links when clicking on the 'works' pictures. This was eventually resolved by putting the works directly into the file and essentially creating a separate 'page' within the original one.
  note- i later found out during office hours that i could have updated my other projects to have a github pages. Not sure which one is more efficient for optimization.
